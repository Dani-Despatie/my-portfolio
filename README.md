# my-portfolio

## Thought Process

The purpose of the website is to introduce who I am at the same time as demonstrating the skills I have with regards to web development, as well as several other useful skills I've accumulated.

In addition it shows some of the work projects that I've completed in the past, with a brief summary of how I contributed ot the projects.

Finally, my contact information is available at the bottom of the website. Since I don't generally use social media this section is not very extensive.

## Setup

If downloading this code yourself, make sure to do the following for it to work:
- Open a new terminal
- Type `yarn install` into the console to download dependencies
- Type `yarn start` into the console

Following these steps should automatically open the website in your default browser, at http://localhost:3000.
